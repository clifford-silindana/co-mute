00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:13.334
Good day. Good day. Full stick
to you. My name is Clifford

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/34-1
00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:17.236
Indiana and I am one of the
applicants who would like to to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/34-2
00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:19.447
join the full stack team as
well.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/58-0
00:00:20.617 --> 00:00:24.415
So as part of my as part of my
application process generate the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/58-1
00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:27.797
the full state team I was
provided with a project that I

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/58-2
00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:30.467
had to complete in a in a period
of the day.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/92-0
00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:36.399
So the the project is called
commute. So just quickly briefly

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/92-1
00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.713
the the whole purpose of commit
is is to address like the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/92-2
00:00:40.713 --> 00:00:44.953
increase in in fuel prices and
also the the high traffic

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/92-3
00:00:44.953 --> 00:00:48.077
congestions on the road. So it's
to help.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/128-0
00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:53.453
Uh commuters to save time on the
road and also to cut down costs

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/128-1
00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:58.263
that come with I'm committing in
in cars. So one of the preview

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/128-2
00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:02.997
preview, the one that was was it
the reporting? So one of the.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/137-0
00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:06.367
One of the one of the
instructions that it provided.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/166-0
00:01:06.787 --> 00:01:11.683
No window on the project was
that like? Yes, as much as as

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/166-1
00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:16.994
much as I really. I was really
pushing to to finish the project

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/166-2
00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:19.317
within the given time frame.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/244-0
00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:25.723
One of the instructions that if
if if there's a, there's a part

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/244-1
00:01:25.723 --> 00:01:29.903
that you didn't get to. I'm I
should comment, I should comment

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/244-2
00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:33.618
it out on the code like
explaining my approach to to to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/244-3
00:01:33.618 --> 00:01:37.732
the program in question. So I go
to myself. Yes, I I I really

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/244-4
00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:42.044
think I really think commenting
would definitely do the justice,

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/244-5
00:01:42.044 --> 00:01:46.025
but I thought perhaps maybe
recording a video and also like

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/244-6
00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:50.071
sharing the code itself and
explaining like the step by step

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/244-7
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:51.597
things that I would do.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/262-0
00:01:51.687 --> 00:01:54.677
Yeah, I thought that would be
even more comprehensible. So I

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/262-1
00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:57.127
hope that the video is gonna be
working received.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/285-0
00:01:57.877 --> 00:02:03.042
Umm so yes, how would like to go
about the presentation is that

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/285-1
00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:07.078
I'm gonna be I'm gonna be
sharing the the project

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/285-2
00:02:07.078 --> 00:02:08.207
specification.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/358-0
00:02:09.877 --> 00:02:13.572
Sharing each feature, that's
that that's expected from the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/358-1
00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:17.579
project and with the feature I'm
gonna be showing on the on the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/358-2
00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.649
code itself and the the the site
itself. How that feature is, is

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/358-3
00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:25.531
is is getting achieved and then
when the features themselves,

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/358-4
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:29.163
I'd like to request to start
with the features that I was

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/358-5
00:02:29.163 --> 00:02:32.982
able to get you on time and and
then move on to the features

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/358-6
00:02:32.982 --> 00:02:36.864
that I couldn't finish one time.
And also it's been how I was

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/358-7
00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:38.617
going to how would you move.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/367-0
00:02:38.897 --> 00:02:44.257
Ohh, into toys, toys, tickling
those those questions.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/375-0
00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:48.357
So now to to just quickly share
my code.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/381-0
00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:50.957
I'm gonna be sharing my screen
now.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/392-0
00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:02.611
All right, so this is the, this
is the page description that I'm

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/392-1
00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:03.357
going to be.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/397-0
00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:06.687
Consider referring to.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/404-0
00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:09.307
I'm going to be considering too.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/476-0
00:03:09.817 --> 00:03:13.528
Umm. And also just just please
please bear with me with the,

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/476-1
00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:17.178
with the ambient noise. So
what's happening is that my room

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/476-2
00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:20.706
is is, is, is just it's more
quiet but then I had to move

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/476-3
00:03:20.706 --> 00:03:24.599
from my room to come down here
because I have no shooting right

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/476-4
00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.553
now and yeah it's it's it's it's
it's it's quite it's quite dark

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/476-5
00:03:28.553 --> 00:03:32.081
in there like I wouldn't I
wouldn't I wouldn't be visible

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/476-6
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:34.757
here so please bear with me with
the noise.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/488-0
00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:41.206
So this is the yes, I was saying
this is the requirements

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/488-1
00:03:41.206 --> 00:03:41.607
document.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/490-0
00:03:42.607 --> 00:03:43.917
And.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/507-0
00:03:45.187 --> 00:03:48.449
If we see So what I'm gonna be
doing is I'm going to be

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/507-1
00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:49.497
referring to this.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/510-0
00:03:50.447 --> 00:03:51.337
And then.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/513-0
00:03:52.687 --> 00:03:53.487
OK so.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/528-0
00:03:57.837 --> 00:04:02.770
So excuse me about that. So as
as I mentioned earlier, the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/528-1
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.107
whole the whole.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/552-0
00:04:05.017 --> 00:04:08.984
Concept of the whole purpose of
the project is to cut down on

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/552-1
00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:12.823
costs and also the the time
wasted one on high high traffic

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/552-2
00:04:12.823 --> 00:04:13.207
rules.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/572-0
00:04:14.157 --> 00:04:18.568
And then yeah, two just don't
start on the project itself. So

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/572-1
00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:20.987
these are the project looks
like.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/615-0
00:04:23.217 --> 00:04:27.008
Like on the on the first page,
when the user when the user for

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/615-1
00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:30.798
example types in commute to suit
the there's a thing that they

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/615-2
00:04:30.798 --> 00:04:34.529
wanna see on the on the screen.
So this is gonna be the login

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/615-3
00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.597
form. The login form that they
wanna use and then.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/624-0
00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:41.757
OK. So just to go with the
comments documents step by step.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/631-0
00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:43.997
So this was gonna happen here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/633-0
00:04:45.247 --> 00:04:45.777
No.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/651-0
00:04:47.027 --> 00:04:51.084
Alright, so there the the first
functionality is that a user

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/651-1
00:04:51.084 --> 00:04:54.077
will have to be able to register
themselves.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/684-0
00:04:54.757 --> 00:04:58.581
So when we come here on this
page, we wanna click on new to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/684-1
00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:02.596
commute, join the family and I
click there and then it's gonna

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/684-2
00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:06.292
take it to your page on which
you can be able to register

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/684-3
00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:07.757
yourself as a new user.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/687-0
00:05:08.637 --> 00:05:09.987
And then.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/692-0
00:05:10.937 --> 00:05:13.207
So you're gonna find all the
fields here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/697-0
00:05:14.427 --> 00:05:15.717
All the necessary pills.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/712-0
00:05:16.557 --> 00:05:20.975
Uh, names and name, phone,
e-mail, password is it's

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/712-1
00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:24.627
required on the description here
and also.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/754-0
00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:29.703
You might be seeing that there's
there's there's. There's two

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/754-1
00:05:29.703 --> 00:05:33.579
extra fields here that I added
when I explain why I decided to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/754-2
00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:37.394
to to go with those groups as
well, because there's a feature

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/754-3
00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:40.717
that I thought would be very
hopeful that for such a.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/758-0
00:05:41.537 --> 00:05:42.527
Was such a project.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/778-0
00:05:43.387 --> 00:05:46.715
Umm, so we thought that this. I
mean, I'm in a communal area, so

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/778-1
00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:49.837
there's gonna be voices around
me. Now if you know and then.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/784-0
00:05:50.747 --> 00:05:53.597
So this is the best.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/788-0
00:05:56.237 --> 00:05:57.177
This is the first.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/802-0
00:05:59.657 --> 00:06:02.771
Is the first comment here. It's
gonna be a huge play this form

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/802-1
00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:03.067
again.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/814-0
00:06:03.827 --> 00:06:07.229
And then yeah, so this is this
is one of the person that I

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/814-1
00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:07.747
couldn't.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/854-0
00:06:09.397 --> 00:06:13.270
Couldn't finish, so like the
notification part, but like how

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/854-1
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.015
would go with this part share is
that I would use Firebase

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/854-2
00:06:17.015 --> 00:06:20.506
because what Firebase does is
that you can see it as a

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/854-3
00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:22.347
functionality or fictionally.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/857-0
00:06:22.937 --> 00:06:23.657
Umm.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/872-0
00:06:24.537 --> 00:06:28.300
Creating creating a user for you
and then after that you wanna be

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/872-1
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.067
able to authenticate that user.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/905-0
00:06:30.627 --> 00:06:34.538
Uh, with with e-mail in
personality. So that's that's

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/905-1
00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:38.883
how we move towards treating
towards finishing this part of

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/905-2
00:06:38.883 --> 00:06:43.300
the authentication and then
after creating the account, it's

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/905-3
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.717
gonna automatically navigate you
to to the login page again.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/925-0
00:06:48.977 --> 00:06:52.206
And then when I come back to
login page and then going back

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/925-1
00:06:52.206 --> 00:06:53.927
to your comments document again.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/934-0
00:06:55.257 --> 00:06:58.077
OK, so it seems like we're not
gonna be able to.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/946-0
00:06:59.927 --> 00:07:03.459
OK, there's a login, there's
login function to the bottom,

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/946-1
00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:04.177
but I think.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1014-0
00:07:04.317 --> 00:07:08.730
Ohm I should stuck with it now
since it's very close to the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1014-1
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.438
anticipation is well. So just to
address that quickly. So as as

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1014-2
00:07:13.438 --> 00:07:17.924
as I mentioned before that so
the attention part is the part

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1014-3
00:07:17.924 --> 00:07:22.484
that I couldn't get to you in
time, but how would go about it

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1014-4
00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:26.824
is that from here on you the
user would insert that e-mail

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1014-5
00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:31.090
then password and also and I
would authenticate them with

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1014-6
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.767
Firebase and from then they'll
be able to access.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1042-0
00:07:35.007 --> 00:07:38.833
The exclusive descriptive pages
of the site because they are

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1042-1
00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:42.658
part of the of the site. They're
registered users, so that's

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1042-2
00:07:42.658 --> 00:07:46.483
gonna be covering the login,
which is a file that is spelled

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1042-3
00:07:46.483 --> 00:07:47.047
out here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1068-0
00:07:47.787 --> 00:07:51.188
So when I get to again now to
save time, I'm not gonna be

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1068-1
00:07:51.188 --> 00:07:54.707
probably gonna again because
I've seen what I'd like to say

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1068-2
00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:56.407
about it. The the login part.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1071-0
00:07:57.367 --> 00:07:58.077
And then.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1090-0
00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:02.635
So another another change with
the login is that after the user

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1090-1
00:08:02.635 --> 00:08:06.237
logs in, this is the first page
that this supposed to see if.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1123-0
00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:10.939
Which is the the the couples
that was that a user has joined.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1123-1
00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:14.833
So these are all your couples
here. And then I'm gonna explain

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1123-2
00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:17.367
what is supposed to happen here
as well.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1130-0
00:08:18.467 --> 00:08:21.797
So right to go back here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1134-0
00:08:24.367 --> 00:08:26.617
Alright, so we've covered.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1144-0
00:08:30.907 --> 00:08:33.447
OK. We've covered, we've covered
the the that you use it.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1232-0
00:08:34.067 --> 00:08:37.222
And then now we're gonna be
covering the new couple

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1232-1
00:08:37.222 --> 00:08:41.044
opportunity. So a new couple of
opportunity essentially is, is

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1232-2
00:08:41.044 --> 00:08:45.048
someone going into their app and
saying, OK, I'm gonna be on this

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1232-3
00:08:45.048 --> 00:08:48.567
day, I'm gonna be going from,
for example, join aspect to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1232-4
00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:52.328
Pretoria. And then this is the
number of seats that I have in

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1232-5
00:08:52.328 --> 00:08:56.211
my car. And then, yeah, this is
this is the number of days that

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1232-6
00:08:56.211 --> 00:08:59.911
I have until like 4 for when,
like, my, my, my, my couple is

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1232-7
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:03.794
available. And then anyone who
wants to join me on that on that

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1232-8
00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:04.097
trip.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1257-0
00:09:04.177 --> 00:09:08.366
Is is able to to do that. So
this is gonna be achieved by

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1257-1
00:09:08.366 --> 00:09:12.843
this part share. So the user
from this the home page and when

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1257-2
00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:14.937
I click on create cover both.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1264-0
00:09:16.177 --> 00:09:17.887
That's when I need them to the
speech here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1280-0
00:09:19.047 --> 00:09:22.347
So there's a user ID here and
when explaining why that comes

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1280-1
00:09:22.347 --> 00:09:22.887
about but.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1320-0
00:09:24.267 --> 00:09:28.379
This was for testing purposes
because I'm working with a a

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1320-1
00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:32.282
database so that they can, so
they're gonna insert that

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1320-2
00:09:32.282 --> 00:09:36.463
departure time expected forever
time origin. He's available

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1320-3
00:09:36.463 --> 00:09:40.853
destination available seats, an
owner, any other special rules

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1320-4
00:09:40.853 --> 00:09:42.177
as required to buy.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1328-0
00:09:42.657 --> 00:09:45.667
Uh, it's the the project
specification here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1331-0
00:09:46.657 --> 00:09:47.407
And then.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1334-0
00:09:49.357 --> 00:09:49.917
Let's see.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1339-0
00:09:52.007 --> 00:09:53.437
All right, so currently.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1343-0
00:09:55.957 --> 00:09:57.967
Currently it's.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1349-0
00:09:59.947 --> 00:10:01.897
Because they could cause the
the.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1364-0
00:10:03.317 --> 00:10:07.600
I was testing it with the with
the JSON server right now, which

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1364-1
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.737
is this one here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1396-0
00:10:09.587 --> 00:10:13.905
She's just one mute, but there
is. There is an actual C#

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1396-1
00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:18.450
server, the vacant which is this
one here that I built with

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1396-2
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.177
asp.net core. So to test out
which.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1402-0
00:10:22.047 --> 00:10:23.437
Jason server first.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1404-0
00:10:24.317 --> 00:10:24.627
No.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1412-0
00:10:25.817 --> 00:10:28.907
These are the example. Maybe
like if you can see here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1430-0
00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:34.169
There's only three of them now,
so if you try to add a couple,

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1430-1
00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:36.697
maybe departure time is 3:00
o'clock.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1433-0
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:37.827
The hips.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1440-0
00:10:38.817 --> 00:10:40.797
And then this is.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1443-0
00:10:41.457 --> 00:10:42.217
After three.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1457-0
00:10:43.187 --> 00:10:46.117
In the origin, probably. Let's
say we won the porch.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1464-0
00:10:48.557 --> 00:10:50.657
And in the case available, maybe
it's true.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1472-0
00:10:51.377 --> 00:10:53.687
Destination is town perhaps?

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1489-0
00:10:54.427 --> 00:10:58.944
Just for example purposes, in
the name of 1 CS remaining and

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1489-1
00:10:58.944 --> 00:11:00.277
then maybe it's a.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1495-0
00:11:01.537 --> 00:11:03.247
I don't know. I'm staying.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1504-0
00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:09.287
Something like that. Special
knows. Maybe he's.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1510-0
00:11:11.027 --> 00:11:13.157
Things next steps.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1516-0
00:11:15.197 --> 00:11:16.547
But then I create the couple.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1531-0
00:11:17.217 --> 00:11:20.316
And then after the couple is
created, we can go to the JSON

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1531-1
00:11:20.316 --> 00:11:20.987
server again.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1536-0
00:11:21.767 --> 00:11:23.037
And then you will see that.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1590-0
00:11:24.197 --> 00:11:28.105
There's a new couple those
created here. So for this one I

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1590-1
00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:32.080
was testing out the API, but
since it's supposed to work on

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1590-2
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.054
the real Life API, what I can
what I what I will do in that

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1590-3
00:11:36.054 --> 00:11:40.160
case is that I'll come to the
couple here. So instead of this

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1590-4
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.207
part of the URL here which is
linking to the.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1611-0
00:11:44.117 --> 00:11:48.829
The the Jason server which is
this one here no rather this one

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1611-1
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:52.867
here. No one will opening. I
would replace that with.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1616-0
00:11:54.737 --> 00:11:57.877
This actual API here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1619-0
00:11:58.967 --> 00:11:59.287
Umm.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1624-0
00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:09.497
So this thing has two.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1626-0
00:12:10.027 --> 00:12:10.747
So are we.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1639-0
00:12:14.687 --> 00:12:17.363
So these are the couples. Yeah.
So instead of using a JSON

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1639-1
00:12:17.363 --> 00:12:18.677
server, replace it with this.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1683-0
00:12:20.277 --> 00:12:24.797
API endpoint here and then it's
gonna go to our actual database.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1683-1
00:12:24.797 --> 00:12:29.038
That's that's the. That's how we
do it would work in in real

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1683-2
00:12:29.038 --> 00:12:33.141
life. And then so that's that's
part of the creating a new

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1683-3
00:12:33.141 --> 00:12:35.087
couple opportunity and then.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1687-0
00:12:36.817 --> 00:12:37.457
Can you see?

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1758-0
00:12:39.077 --> 00:12:42.604
So to join and leave couple
opportunity so this one here is

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1758-1
00:12:42.604 --> 00:12:46.014
gonna be covered by this
passion. So you're gonna come to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1758-2
00:12:46.014 --> 00:12:49.717
all couples and they're gonna
see all of the couples here that

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1758-3
00:12:49.717 --> 00:12:53.185
are that are that were ever
created in there but so so for

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1758-4
00:12:53.185 --> 00:12:57.006
example origin Pretoria and then
if you want to see more details

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1758-5
00:12:57.006 --> 00:13:00.533
about it you're gonna click on
the view couple so right now

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1758-6
00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:03.707
it's not showing anything which
is another part that.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1772-0
00:13:05.027 --> 00:13:11.424
I haven't gotten to yet, so here
for example, it's it's it's

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1772-1
00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:12.367
dragging.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1786-0
00:13:13.277 --> 00:13:15.951
So at this point also shows that
the API does work actually

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1786-1
00:13:15.951 --> 00:13:16.307
because.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1814-0
00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:20.973
This punch? Yeah, is pulling
this data from from an API

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1814-1
00:13:20.973 --> 00:13:25.468
endpoint like our actual one,
not the Jason server. And we can

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1814-2
00:13:25.468 --> 00:13:26.467
see this from.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1819-0
00:13:27.297 --> 00:13:28.247
If I can do this.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1839-0
00:13:30.007 --> 00:13:33.011
Like these are all our couples
in and then just in case this

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1839-1
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.227
one is not clear, but it's in
Jason from it.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1851-0
00:13:36.227 --> 00:13:40.027
We can look at the database here
on Microsoft SQL Server.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1860-0
00:13:41.057 --> 00:13:43.307
So we see that there's a.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1875-0
00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:48.727
For example, if we, if we make a
query on our couples table.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1878-0
00:13:50.007 --> 00:13:50.977
Uh, yeah.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1901-0
00:13:52.367 --> 00:13:55.192
Select all. It's gonna be the
same query result, but then I'm

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1901-1
00:13:55.192 --> 00:13:58.017
just. I just want to show you
again that it's coming from the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1901-2
00:13:58.017 --> 00:13:58.427
database.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1927-0
00:13:59.907 --> 00:14:03.498
So for example, if we look at
this one, the origin is coming

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1927-1
00:14:03.498 --> 00:14:06.971
from the dog jonesburg to
Victoria and then the second one

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1927-2
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.737
is going to specifically they.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1950-0
00:14:10.587 --> 00:14:12.992
So this Chinese picture
pictorial and then join this

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1950-1
00:14:12.992 --> 00:14:15.578
picture case. And so it's
actually pulling data from our

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1950-2
00:14:15.578 --> 00:14:16.167
API endpoint.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1957-0
00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:19.067
And then yes, that's a.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1966-0
00:14:20.307 --> 00:14:22.957
That's it. So from here from
view couple.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1996-0
00:14:23.707 --> 00:14:27.534
What it actually happened here
is that from this component

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1996-1
00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:31.555
here. So this component check
comes with all of these details

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1996-2
00:14:31.555 --> 00:14:35.447
that we find here. So like the
user ID, the departure time,

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/1996-3
00:14:35.447 --> 00:14:37.327
arrival time, it's just that.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2033-0
00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:42.468
For for simplicity, for
simplicity purposes, I only show

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2033-1
00:14:42.468 --> 00:14:46.487
the origin and the destination,
but everything is is is

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2033-2
00:14:46.487 --> 00:14:50.936
accessible and on this company
chip. So if I were to say view

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2033-3
00:14:50.936 --> 00:14:51.797
couple here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2042-0
00:14:52.907 --> 00:14:55.597
Which is represented by this
button here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2049-0
00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:00.267
You see all couples.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2051-0
00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:01.957
This.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2078-0
00:15:02.997 --> 00:15:07.278
So this between this between
here. So it's gonna lead me to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2078-1
00:15:07.278 --> 00:15:10.987
couples slash couple ID which is
this address here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2107-0
00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:16.131
Which is this efficient so this
one defined you would represent

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2107-1
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:20.621
a a couple ID and then from that
couple ID I can request from the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2107-2
00:15:20.621 --> 00:15:22.797
database which is this one here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2122-0
00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:28.468
I can request like write a
sequel query via the using the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2122-1
00:15:28.468 --> 00:15:30.177
Entity Premium Co C#.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2145-0
00:15:31.147 --> 00:15:34.701
Let's say maybe like select
where couple ID equals to two.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2145-1
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:38.555
If there are, if the if the ID
is 2 and then it's gonna give me

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2145-2
00:15:38.555 --> 00:15:39.217
everything.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2181-0
00:15:39.677 --> 00:15:42.996
Come here. And then I'm gonna
show all the details on that

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2181-1
00:15:42.996 --> 00:15:46.482
show page and then something is
that I'm gonna show there is.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2181-2
00:15:46.482 --> 00:15:49.969
I'm gonna show the the join,
join couple or leave. Kapur like

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2181-3
00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:53.287
if if it's a couple that a user
is actually signed up for.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2209-0
00:15:53.997 --> 00:15:57.516
So that's that's. That's how.
How about that part? And then

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2209-1
00:15:57.516 --> 00:16:00.507
the search struggle
opportunities here essentially

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2209-2
00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:04.084
someone is coming to say for
example like they want to go to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2209-3
00:16:04.084 --> 00:16:05.667
Victoria from Johannesburg.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2219-0
00:16:07.417 --> 00:16:09.197
So the person is gonna go into
the app.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2225-0
00:16:10.007 --> 00:16:13.827
And search up see.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2238-0
00:16:14.737 --> 00:16:17.627
So now we come into the app yet
and going to.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2276-0
00:16:19.047 --> 00:16:22.825

00:16:22.825 --> 00:16:26.293
the couples that are ever
generated. As I mentioned. So

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2276-2
00:16:26.293 --> 00:16:29.884
there's a section. There's a
search functionality yet. So

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2276-3
00:16:29.884 --> 00:16:33.476
you're gonna search whatever
like you can search me by by

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2276-4
00:16:33.476 --> 00:16:35.767
origin or by destination or by
date.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2298-0
00:16:37.147 --> 00:16:40.892
And then it's gonna go into the
database, which is all couples

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2298-1
00:16:40.892 --> 00:16:44.577
here, and then bring you all of
the the the relevant results.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2300-0
00:16:45.417 --> 00:16:45.907
Umm.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2303-0
00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:47.947
Let me see.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2336-0
00:16:49.087 --> 00:16:53.063
And then view created couple
opportunities. So this one yeah

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2336-1
00:16:53.063 --> 00:16:57.170
it's it's specific to the to the
user specific to the user. So

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2336-2
00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.037
what happens is that when the
user logs in.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2344-0
00:17:02.117 --> 00:17:04.327
Like upon upon upon looking in
here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2380-0
00:17:05.307 --> 00:17:09.233
So you can see here to say here
are you join the couples user?

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2380-1
00:17:09.233 --> 00:17:12.972
So this is A is representative
of the person who's actually

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2380-2
00:17:12.972 --> 00:17:16.897
logged into the account right
now. So in the same way as with.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2383-0
00:17:18.077 --> 00:17:18.887
The.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2413-0
00:17:19.627 --> 00:17:23.745
The other my couples example
that I that I made so we'll have

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2413-1
00:17:23.745 --> 00:17:27.730
access to like a a user ID
perhaps here and then it's gonna

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2413-2
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.917
and then we're gonna request
from the database.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2455-0
00:17:32.097 --> 00:17:35.847
So if you look at a database,
yeah, if we have an idea of a

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2455-1
00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:39.596
user, we can request a couple
because like the user ID is a

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2455-2
00:17:39.596 --> 00:17:43.471
foreign is a foreign key to the
to the couple of table. So we

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2455-3
00:17:43.471 --> 00:17:47.533
can find all of the couples that
I use that has created based on

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2455-4
00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:48.407
their user ID.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2466-0
00:17:49.117 --> 00:17:52.753
So that's that's. That's how
that would go about this room

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2466-1
00:17:52.753 --> 00:17:53.307
and then.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2515-0
00:17:54.527 --> 00:17:58.190
So the login part I managed
explained if I want you to to go

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2515-1
00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.792
through it again, this is gonna
be very, very long, but I'm

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2515-2
00:18:01.792 --> 00:18:05.454
happy to to answer any question
that can come with that. And

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2515-3
00:18:05.454 --> 00:18:09.296
then the profile part share. So
for the profile the user has to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2515-4
00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:11.337
be able to go into their
profile.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2572-0
00:18:12.957 --> 00:18:17.415
Profile section was to be able
to update their details as part

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2572-1
00:18:17.415 --> 00:18:21.943
of the specifications here, so
this one is gonna be achieved by

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2572-2
00:18:21.943 --> 00:18:26.542
coming to this function. So for
example see this is another part

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2572-3
00:18:26.542 --> 00:18:31.141
that I was trying to explain but
then I had quoted this one here

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2572-4
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:35.670
to to make an example, but I'm
gonna explain how it comes about

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2572-5
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.207
or how it works. So this one
here is the user ID.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2581-0
00:18:39.997 --> 00:18:43.467
So upon upon logging in, you're
gonna have access to.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2606-0
00:18:44.587 --> 00:18:48.876
The user ID, so we're gonna be
using that user ID to to make

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2606-1
00:18:48.876 --> 00:18:53.025
request from our API our SQL
database. So for example with

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2606-2
00:18:53.025 --> 00:18:53.657
this one.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2652-0
00:18:54.437 --> 00:19:00.629
Who requested from our API or or
allow our database the user of

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2652-1
00:19:00.629 --> 00:19:07.015
ID one so the user ID one is for
Gorilla Céline Dion with 477 and

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2652-2
00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:12.433
so on and so on. All of the
details in the able to edit

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2652-3
00:19:12.433 --> 00:19:13.497
cancel the.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2670-0
00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:18.447
Yeah. Details yet. So to show
that this this information is

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2670-1
00:19:18.447 --> 00:19:21.337
really corresponds, we can look
at let me see.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2675-0
00:19:25.607 --> 00:19:28.017
So this was SQL Server as well.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2683-0
00:19:34.777 --> 00:19:36.897
So this is the first user here,
they will come.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2711-0
00:19:37.847 --> 00:19:41.581
With the idea of 1 but Colum
cylinder London just just was

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2711-1
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:44.997
just using myself as a query as
a quick example here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2746-0
00:19:46.157 --> 00:19:50.862
And then so yes, yeah, the
information does cause 100 **.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2746-1
00:19:50.862 --> 00:19:55.567
Here you go. So this is the
information that you will see

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2746-2
00:19:55.567 --> 00:19:58.487
upon creating upon checking on
you.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2802-0
00:19:59.127 --> 00:20:04.807
Your profile I couldn't here and
to show that the editing also

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2802-1
00:20:04.807 --> 00:20:10.667
works. Let's say maybe I changed
this gesture Clifford, and then

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2802-2
00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:16.437
maybe there's 76020000 and then
I edit page. So I've picked it,

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2802-3
00:20:16.437 --> 00:20:21.846
but nothing's happening. That's
because I haven't. I didn't

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2802-4
00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:22.747
implement.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2805-0
00:20:23.427 --> 00:20:24.337
Then.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2831-0
00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:28.503
But in that noise it didn't
implement the the the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2831-1
00:20:28.503 --> 00:20:32.215
navigation, but it's supposed to
automatically navigate you to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2831-2
00:20:32.215 --> 00:20:35.985
like a different page. There's a
form of feedback that you know

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2831-3
00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.047
that you just click now worked
or.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2855-0
00:20:38.677 --> 00:20:42.031
Yeah. Can you then change it to
a different page or like give

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2855-1
00:20:42.031 --> 00:20:45.223
you like a pop up here saying
that, you know what, you you

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2855-2
00:20:45.223 --> 00:20:46.467
editing was successful?

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2866-0
00:20:47.107 --> 00:20:52.079
Umm, so now because I changed
those parts, we can come back

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2866-1
00:20:52.079 --> 00:20:52.327
to.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2869-0
00:20:53.227 --> 00:20:54.197
Can we can go back?

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2961-0
00:20:55.227 --> 00:20:58.737
And then come back to your
profile again. Then we'll see

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2961-1
00:20:58.737 --> 00:21:02.616
that everything is still. See,
it's changed now. It's not only

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2961-2
00:21:02.616 --> 00:21:06.372
Clifford Corolla and it's no
longer the 7621. There's no 00.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2961-3
00:21:06.372 --> 00:21:09.943
So it shows that the 82 was
successful. Then if maybe you

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2961-4
00:21:09.943 --> 00:21:13.760
change your mind, you can click
on back and then consequently

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2961-5
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.701
take you back to your homepage
there. And then there's a logout

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2961-6
00:21:17.701 --> 00:21:21.087
button as well. And then this
foster needs Firebase to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2961-7
00:21:21.087 --> 00:21:24.904
actually, like, go about the
user so that they have to log in

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2961-8
00:21:24.904 --> 00:21:26.197
back again to access.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2964-0
00:21:26.287 --> 00:21:26.927
Order one.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2978-0
00:21:28.017 --> 00:21:32.005
Ohh, the features of the site
and it now I did mention that

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2978-1
00:21:32.005 --> 00:21:33.267
there was an extra.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/2988-0
00:21:34.397 --> 00:21:37.427
I think we see there was on the
registration part.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3051-0
00:21:41.357 --> 00:21:44.471
Just do this when the
registration part. I mentioned

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3051-1
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:47.936
that there was extra fields that
were not mentioned in the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3051-2
00:21:47.936 --> 00:21:51.696
specification and what I thought
to myself was I think it would

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3051-3
00:21:51.696 --> 00:21:55.279
be a bit a bit a bit, maybe a
bit more interesting for me to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3051-4
00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:58.744
to, you know, like challenge
myself a bit more further and

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3051-5
00:21:58.744 --> 00:22:02.327
you know try to use because I'm
aware that we'll advise you.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3065-0
00:22:03.237 --> 00:22:07.748
Preferably use C# and also like
the front end technologies

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3065-1
00:22:07.748 --> 00:22:09.047
JavaScript react.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3113-0
00:22:09.927 --> 00:22:13.871
So I thought to myself, maybe if
I can use this well, try to try

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3113-1
00:22:13.871 --> 00:22:17.632
to see if I can work with two
API on on my project and then I

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3113-2
00:22:17.632 --> 00:22:21.333
I decided that you know what,
maybe I should try to create a

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3113-3
00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:25.033
pitch angle rest API so on this
API here I'm gonna be having

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3113-4
00:22:25.033 --> 00:22:29.037
like a different data. It's it's
an external database altogether.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3158-0
00:22:29.917 --> 00:22:33.571
Umm, it's an external database
linked together, So what it does

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3158-1
00:22:33.571 --> 00:22:36.881
that I thought to myself, you
know what, like, what's the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3158-2
00:22:36.881 --> 00:22:40.478
feature that Sachin app would
like to like would have and that

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3158-3
00:22:40.478 --> 00:22:43.731
would possibly like give
assurance to people like I know

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3158-4
00:22:43.731 --> 00:22:47.327
like it's not a, it's not like a
a project that's going on to.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3197-0
00:22:48.067 --> 00:22:51.623
Uh. Production. But I I thought
it was a nice feature tuned to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3197-1
00:22:51.623 --> 00:22:55.121
take implement and also just to
touch upon my skills as well.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3197-2
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:58.451
Letter to me. So perhaps you
know with with commuting like

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3197-3
00:22:58.451 --> 00:23:02.119
this, I think people would feel
very much safer knowing that you

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3197-4
00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:04.827
know what the vehicles are
actually registered.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3216-0
00:23:06.187 --> 00:23:10.032
And also yeah, like this is
maybe for example like with Home

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3216-1
00:23:10.032 --> 00:23:12.237
Affairs for example, because,
yes.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3224-0
00:23:13.617 --> 00:23:15.457
You know. Yes, it's it's, it's
not to say that.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3291-0
00:23:16.817 --> 00:23:20.884
National like Citizens do not
get up to any mischievous acts

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3291-1
00:23:20.884 --> 00:23:24.950
of crime, but I think it is. I
really do think that if if if

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3291-2
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:29.216
someone is assured that you know
what the details of the driver

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3291-3
00:23:29.216 --> 00:23:33.282
are available at Home Office,
the driver is very less likely

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3291-4
00:23:33.282 --> 00:23:37.215
to to like create like like
perform any crime because they

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3291-5
00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:41.414
know that you know they can be
tricked very easily. So this is

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3291-6
00:23:41.414 --> 00:23:45.147
the this is the the purpose of
these extra fields here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3309-0
00:23:45.547 --> 00:23:49.835
With the vehicle description and
the vehicle registration so the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3309-1
00:23:49.835 --> 00:23:52.737
vehicle registration is gonna be
linked to.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3377-0
00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:57.688
Like that external database
because that extended and then

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3377-1
00:23:57.688 --> 00:24:01.913
that external database has not
only these two fields but also

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3377-2
00:24:01.913 --> 00:24:06.070
like the the name of the driver
at the cinema of the driver,

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3377-3
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.091
that identity number of the
driver and so on and so on. Is

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3377-4
00:24:10.091 --> 00:24:14.521
it so upon upon joining here if
the user is joining as a as a as

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3377-5
00:24:14.521 --> 00:24:17.587
a driver here and seeing if
applicable here?

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3392-0
00:24:18.847 --> 00:24:22.885
They can give that description
and also their registration, and

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3392-1
00:24:22.885 --> 00:24:23.957
then we'll go to.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3400-0
00:24:24.697 --> 00:24:27.287
So this is the API that I
created for the.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3421-0
00:24:28.187 --> 00:24:32.318
It's an added babies. Uh using
Jingle in Jingle this framework.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3421-1
00:24:32.318 --> 00:24:34.577
So for example with this one
here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3478-0
00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:39.167
It's still being all the details
of the travelers. And then right

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3478-1
00:24:39.167 --> 00:24:42.852
now it's just one driver because
I had only like, I just put in

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3478-2
00:24:42.852 --> 00:24:46.422
one example here for like for
for example purposes, but it it

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3478-3
00:24:46.422 --> 00:24:49.762
would look something very much
like this. So you see here

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3478-4
00:24:49.762 --> 00:24:52.813
there's there's vehicle
registration. I mean we know

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3478-5
00:24:52.813 --> 00:24:56.498
that every vehicle registration
is unique. So with this vehicle

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3478-6
00:24:56.498 --> 00:24:57.937
registration here we can.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3481-0
00:24:58.637 --> 00:25:00.087
Umm. Like.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3493-0
00:25:01.207 --> 00:25:05.677
Run it. We can like compute,
compare it with the.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3566-0
00:25:06.827 --> 00:25:10.834
The the details that the that
the user is is, is is attempting

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3566-1
00:25:10.834 --> 00:25:14.969
to register with one commute and
then we wanna be comparing them

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3566-2
00:25:14.969 --> 00:25:19.166
with this external database here
and then seeing that OK like was

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3566-3
00:25:19.166 --> 00:25:23.237
this specific vehicle registered
with Home Affairs or something

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3566-4
00:25:23.237 --> 00:25:27.371
like that. You know? So because
we know that if the registration

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3566-5
00:25:27.371 --> 00:25:31.506
we have the driver name which is
shown here and then we have the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3566-6
00:25:31.506 --> 00:25:35.322
driver send e-mail. So I'm in
more details. These were just

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3566-7
00:25:35.322 --> 00:25:36.657
for example purposes.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3578-0
00:25:37.217 --> 00:25:40.108
And this is the kind of
information that would have on

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3578-1
00:25:40.108 --> 00:25:41.317
the driver if they use.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3584-0
00:25:42.257 --> 00:25:44.167
Like vehicle registration in the
vehicle.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3653-0
00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:49.380
Description like this on on the
commute app so I thought I

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3653-1
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.800
thought that would be like an
extra, you know, it's not

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3653-2
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.526
specified on the on the app. I
know that I may be giving you

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3653-3
00:25:56.526 --> 00:26:00.129
more work, but I thought it's
very something that you know

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3653-4
00:26:00.129 --> 00:26:03.915
would be interesting to to to
implement and also just to just

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3653-5
00:26:03.915 --> 00:26:07.518
to test out some some more
skills as well. So yeah, that's

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3653-6
00:26:07.518 --> 00:26:08.617
a that's about it.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3659-0
00:26:09.717 --> 00:26:11.147
Otherwise, like All in all.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3670-0
00:26:11.977 --> 00:26:16.283
Ohh and also the this one last
thing that I wanted to to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3670-1
00:26:16.283 --> 00:26:16.887
mention.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3672-0
00:26:17.387 --> 00:26:17.767
Uh.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3681-0
00:26:19.307 --> 00:26:22.297
Is that, uh, this part here?

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3711-0
00:26:23.517 --> 00:26:27.756
So what happens with this is
that when when a user is gonna

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3711-1
00:26:27.756 --> 00:26:32.278
be deleting like they are like
for example if a user is deleted

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3711-2
00:26:32.278 --> 00:26:34.397
from the from the site itself.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3719-0
00:26:35.167 --> 00:26:37.857
So if we look at for example.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3775-0
00:26:38.637 --> 00:26:42.377
User ID him so user ID is a
foreign key to the couple ID as

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3775-1
00:26:42.377 --> 00:26:46.429
I mentioned. So what this means
is that if a user gets this gets

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3775-2
00:26:46.429 --> 00:26:50.356
deleted from the from the site
then automatically all of their

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3775-3
00:26:50.356 --> 00:26:53.784
couples that they've ever
created are also going to be

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3775-4
00:26:53.784 --> 00:26:57.337
deleted. And if I can just show
something quickly again.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3778-0
00:26:58.557 --> 00:26:59.047
Is.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3784-0
00:27:13.607 --> 00:27:14.697
OK, me.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3790-0
00:27:23.207 --> 00:27:24.167
But they're supposed to be.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3799-0
00:27:24.247 --> 00:27:27.897
We can see your food Turks
location.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3803-0
00:27:29.907 --> 00:27:31.057
So this.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3812-0
00:27:32.277 --> 00:27:34.507
I might be that you you missing
my.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3814-0
00:27:35.627 --> 00:27:35.967
See.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3871-0
00:27:44.627 --> 00:27:48.505
So there's a cascade to ease.
This is the rules occur, the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3871-1
00:27:48.505 --> 00:27:52.645
delete called Caskey. So what
cascade means is that if we have

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3871-2
00:27:52.645 --> 00:27:56.851
a foreign key like for example
like user ID is a foreign key to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3871-3
00:27:56.851 --> 00:28:00.860
to to to the couple table. What
that means is that if you're

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3871-4
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.817
gonna be deleting a user, then
all of their.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3931-0
00:28:04.987 --> 00:28:09.117
Couples that they've ever
created are also going to be

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3931-1
00:28:09.117 --> 00:28:13.548
treated, so that's gonna be
handled by that rule here that

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3931-2
00:28:13.548 --> 00:28:17.978
there was also something that
might be put into mention as

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3931-3
00:28:17.978 --> 00:28:22.483
well. And yeah, just to to to
move over time at this point.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3931-4
00:28:22.483 --> 00:28:27.214
But just to to to keep it very
short. I'm gonna leave it here.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3931-5
00:28:27.214 --> 00:28:31.945
Appreciate you looking at the
video up to this point. And I am

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/3931-6
00:28:31.945 --> 00:28:34.197
available e-mail or via phone.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4001-0
00:28:34.647 --> 00:28:38.046
For you and the federal
questions, and yeah, like no

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4001-1
00:28:38.046 --> 00:28:41.959
notice on, honestly, no, not to
sound cliche, but I actually

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4001-2
00:28:41.959 --> 00:28:45.807
did. If you did have fun with
the project, it was there was

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4001-3
00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:49.719
high pressure ease but it it it
allowed me to to bring it to

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4001-4
00:28:49.719 --> 00:28:53.631
middle 80s for example. Now I
know that you know I can I can

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4001-5
00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:57.287
try to temper around with
multiple API's in the same the

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4001-6
00:28:57.287 --> 00:28:57.607
same.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4059-0
00:28:57.687 --> 00:29:02.266
From from where application and
also with Firebase as well like

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4059-1
00:29:02.266 --> 00:29:06.415
Firebase it's a good like I've
worked with authentication

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4059-2
00:29:06.415 --> 00:29:10.850
before but I was using a A GWT
JavaScript web tokens compared

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4059-3
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.928
to Firebase language GWT. I
really like the longer route

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4059-4
00:29:14.928 --> 00:29:19.291
towards authentication. So now I
know that you know what I'm

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4059-5
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:21.437
gonna I'm gonna be looking at.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4082-0
00:29:21.577 --> 00:29:26.953
I'm a fair piece in more detail
from now one thing and it makes

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4082-1
00:29:26.953 --> 00:29:31.741
things a bit more quicker for
for like quicker. You know

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4082-2
00:29:31.741 --> 00:29:33.337
projects like this.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4117-0
00:29:34.477 --> 00:29:38.606
Definitely I'm jitter, which is
also has its own advantages, but

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4117-1
00:29:38.606 --> 00:29:42.353
I think for for understanding
concepts fire base does help

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4117-2
00:29:42.353 --> 00:29:46.100
with with that because it's
quicker. Ohh so yeah, just two

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4117-3
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.577
that's that's that's that's it
for me.

4b63b7e6-d608-4f4c-8554-7f1d4c6fcf57/4129-0
00:29:49.677 --> 00:29:54.448
